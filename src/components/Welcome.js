        <h2>Welcome!</h2>  
        <p>Hello there! My name is Becky, and I am so glad you are here visiting my virtual store. 
            I'm sure you are looking for a wild story on how Serenity In Soap came to be, but mine is just a simple one.</p> 
        <p>I woke up one morning in 2001 and the idea to make soap was just....there. I don't know where it came from. 
            I didn't have any friends or family that made soap at the time. 
            I didn't even know my great-grandma had made her own until years later. 
            I suppose one could say it was a calling of sorts.</p>
        <p>So Christmas came that year, and my family gave me a gift of melt and pour glycerin. 
            I was so excited!! My family got lots of samples to try in the next several months, and when I thought I had a good line up, 
            I got a seller's permit and took it all to some local craft fairs. I was able to sell enough to cover my costs, and I was happy with that.</p>
        <p>In 2007 I started wondering how soap was made in the "olden days". So the journey continued with countless hours of research and reading. 
            This was before there were so many awesome videos on YouTube. I know...crazy, right?! 
            It's true!! No videos. Just lots of reading to make sure I understood the process. 
            Then I finally got the courage to make my first cold process soap batch, and it was game on!</p>
        <p>Now, 10 years later, it's time to put this into action and do something with this little passion of mine. 
            There were a lot of trials and tribulations on the road to Serenity In Soap, but the desire to be my own boss has taken over. 
            I just have to see where it will take me. So I put my heart and passion into every batch I make, and I sure hope you all can see and feel it as you use the products.</p>
